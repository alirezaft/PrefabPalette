# Prefab Palette
Prefab Palette allows you to put your frequently used prefabs somewhere easy to reach so you don't need to move form a folder to another to find a prefab and put it in the scene, so you can save your time and energy for more important things.</br>
You can also save a palette to use it later in your project.
